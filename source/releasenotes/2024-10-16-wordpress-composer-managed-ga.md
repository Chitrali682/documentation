We are excited to announce that our [WordPress (Composer Managed)](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-composer-managed) upstream is now in general availability. This means it is fully supported in production environments.

**No action is required on your part.** You can use the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream via Terminus or the site creation link in our [documentation](/guides/integrated-composer/create#wordpress-with-integrated-composer-and-bedrock). In a future update, you may also have the option to install a Composer-based version of WordPress directly from the Pantheon site dashboard.

Our [Integrated Composer documentation](/guides/integrated-composer) has been updated to include information about the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream. All previous WordPress Composer documentation has been integrated into existing documentation and redirected for easier access.

As always, if you encounter any issues with the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-composer-managed/issues) on our GitHub repository or ask a question in our [Community Slack](https://slackin.pantheon.io/).
