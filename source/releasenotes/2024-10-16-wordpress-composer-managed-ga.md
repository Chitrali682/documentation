We are excited to announce that our [WordPress (Composer Managed)](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-composer-managed) upstream is now considered to be in general availability. This means that the upstream is now fully supported for your use in production environments.

There are no changes required on your part. The WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream can be used via Terminus or the site creation link in our [documentation](/guides/integrated-composer/create#wordpress-with-integrated-composer-and-bedrock). An option to install a Composer-based version of WordPress from the Pantheon Site Dashboard may be available in a future update.

Our [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) documentation has been updated to include information about the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream and all previous WordPress Composer documentation has been integrated into existing documentation and redirected for easier access.

As before, if you have problems with the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-composer-managed/issues) on our GitHub repository or ask a question in our [Community Slack](https://slackin.pantheon.io/).
